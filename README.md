 Mobile Phone held in landscape mode, tilting up and down using the gyroscope/accelerometer sensor to control a ball’s vertical movement, while trying to hit one of the bats at a time and accumulate points until all three rounds are lost. Rounds are lost by missing the bats on the right or left side of the game area.
