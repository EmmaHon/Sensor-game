# Rigged Pong
Metropolia UAS Sensor Based Mobile Applications TX00CK66-3004 course project

The main idea of Rigged Pong game project Mobile Phone held in portrait mode, tilting up/down/right/left using the gyroscope/accelerometer sensor to control a ball’s x-y-axis movement, while trying to hit one of the bats at a time and accumulate points until all three rounds are lost. Rounds are lost by missing the bats three times on the game area's up or down sides and hitting the wrong bat.During game over the player is shown his/hers score and the highest score played.

**Getting started**  

For this project we used [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/ "Android Studio") and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/ "Kotlin") language with the integration of [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com / "LibGDX").
LibGDX has switched to Gradle, so 3rd party libraries can be added through the build.gradle(Module: app) file. 


Requirements for this application is an Android device which has API level 24 or higher which is Android version (Nougat) 7.0 - 7.1.2 or newer.
LibGDX requires the minimum ofJava Development Kit 8+ (Must be JDK) and Android Studio , 3.1.2 to work. LibGDX was chosen for for this project as it is a free, open source cross platform game development framework.
LibGDX can be downloaded through this here: https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/dist/gdx-setup.jar.

*Week 1 schedule*  

For very first week we applied:  
* project skeleton (Main menu view)
* studying about libGDX and how to integrate it
* studying about how to implement accelerometer
* designing game art with our game designer


---

*Week 1 results*  

* sprites
* accelerometer
* ball’s movement
* start menu
* gameScreen
* mock-ups
* UI/UX testing

---  

*Week 2 schedule*  

For our second week we scheduled:  
* game over screen
* Ai for the bats
* grafics
* leaderboard/highscores
* instructions (how to play)
* UI/UX testing

**Wrapping up the project**

For the last week 3 we concentrated getting all the most important implementations and features to work. We improved also our layout and added automatic device language in Finnish and in English. We concentrated finessing our accelerometer and physics as well as saving our score data. Based on user feedback we also added game info to our start menu.
