The main idea of Rigged Pong game project is to increase your score by hitting paddles on the sides of the screen with a ball. Player controls the ball tilting the phone in x-y-axis, using the accelerometer sensor. Player starts with three rounds and they are lost by entering the "death zone" behind the paddles. After all three rounds are lost, the player can see their score on the Game Over-screen

**Getting started**  

For this project we used [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/ "Android Studio") and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/ "Kotlin") language with the integration of [libGDX](https://github.com/libGDX/libGDX "LibGDX") .
LibGDX has switched to Gradle, so 3rd party libraries can be added through the build.gradle(Module: app) file. 

LibGdx libraries used: 
* Box2D
* Freetype

--- 

*Week 1 schedule*  

For very first week we applied:  
* project skeleton (Main menu view)
* studying about libGDX and how to integrate it
* studying about how to implement accelerometer
* designing game art with our game designer


---

*Week 1 results*  

* sprites
* accelerometer
* ballâ€™s movement
* start menu
* gameScreen
* mock-ups
* UI/UX testing

---  

*Week 2 schedule*  

For our second week we scheduled:  
* game over screen
* Ai for the bats
* grafics
* leaderboard/highscores
* instructions (how to play)
* UI/UX testing

**Wrapping up the project**

For the last week 3 we concentrated getting all the most important implementations and features to work. We improved also our layout and added automatic device language in Finnish and in English. We concentrated finessing our accelerometer and physics as well as saving our score data. Based on user feedback we also added game info to our start menu.
